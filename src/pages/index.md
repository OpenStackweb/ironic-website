        Now that we’re further down the funnel, this is where we start to tell how.   
        We have the chance to peel back a few more layers, getting a glimpse into the details   
        that make this project work. The easiest form factor to use is a block of text, as   
        shown here. This option will be the least effective, though. If the project has a diagram     
        or video to help with the “how”, this will be a great place to put that. Think of each of   
        these sections as modular blocks that can be added if content is ready.

        This is a quote from one of the project's users. Ideally, we will have
        something like this, with substance, to validate the claim that this
        brand name uses and likes the project if we don't have a logo

    What's the quickest way to give a project the perception of credibility?
    Tell the reader that people (or organizations) they know are already using
    it. The most effective way to do that is with logos, but if logos aren't
    available we can use text.
