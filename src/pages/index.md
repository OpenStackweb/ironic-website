        Airship is a collection of loosely coupled but interoperable open source
        tools that declaratively automate cloud provisioning. Airship is a
        robust delivery mechanism for organizations who want to embrace
        containers as the new unit of infrastructure delivery at scale. Starting
        from raw bare metal infrastructure, Airship manages the full lifecycle
        of data center infrastructure to deliver a production-grade Kubernetes
        cluster with Helm deployed artifacts, including OpenStack-Helm. Airship
        allows operators to manage their infrastructure deployments and
        lifecycle through the declarative YAML documents that describe an
        Airship environment.

        Infrastructure is managed through declarative YAML files and there is
        one workflow for both  deployments and updates. Airship does not require
        operators to develop their own set of complex  orchestration tooling to
        automate Airship.
      title: Simple    
    - text: >
        Containers and Helm charts are the basic unit of deployment for all
        software including Airship  itself, pushing software orchestration logic
        to the edge. Expanding the software stack is as  simple as adding new
        charts to Airship declarations.
      title: Flexible    
    - text: >
        Platform state including all versions are specified declaratively, and
        Airship, Helm, and Kubernetes  align containers, dependencies, and
        configuration in the same way every time.
      title: Repeatable    
    - text: >
        All jobs and services are running as containers, provide health status,
        and are healed by Kubernetes  supervision by taking full advantage of
        native Kubernetes resiliency.
      title: Resilient    
    - text: >
        The Airship components themselves are deployed as Helm charts and run as
        services within Kubernetes.  This allows them to be upgraded like any
        other software component in the system.

  title: Users show credibility, without logos
  text: >
    What's the quickest way to give a project the perception of credibility? Tell
    the reader that people (or organizations) they know are already using it.
    The most effective way to do that is with logos, but if logos aren't available
    we can use text.

        This is a quote from one of the project's users. Ideally, we will have
        something like this, with substance, to validate the claim that this
        brand name uses and likes the project if we don't have a logo
