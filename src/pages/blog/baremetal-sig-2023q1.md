New year - new Bare Metal SIG meetings! Starting with 2023, we're switching to
a quarterly cadence, while making the meetings longer, more entertaining and
opening the floor for more active engagement. The first event will take place
on Wednesday, Feb 8th, from 15:00 to 17:00 UTC. We will use Zoom, the link will
be announced later - keep an eye on [our blog](/blog/) and the [openstack-discuss
mailing list](https://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss).

The agenda looks like this:

1. Meet'n'greet: news from Bare Metal SIG, Ironic and the ecosystem. `[15
   minutes]`

2. Panel discussion: things you didn't know Ironic can do for you. Are you
   doing something absolutely crazy with Ironic?  Have you ever been afraid to get
   kicked from IRC for even asking about the use case you have? Time to shine!
   Come and show us that Ironic is not only about provisioning qcow2 images
   through PXE. `[30 minutes]`

3. Panel discussion: scaling bare metal provisioning (Ironic and beyond). How
   do you make these racks of servers buzz together? Come talk to experts from
   CERN, G-Research Open Source Software team, and Red Hat. Bonus from us:
   introduction into the new "sharding" feature! `[30 minutes]`

4. Open floor. Any topics welcome, but the suggested topic of the day: battle
   stories! Share your most crazy bare metal craziness for good laugh and
   education.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Arne Wiebalck (`arne_wiebalck`),
Dmitry Tantsur (`dtantsur`) or Jay Faulkner (`JayF`) on
[IRC](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/contributor/community.html#internet-relay-chat-irc).
